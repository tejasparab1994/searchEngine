a method for incrementally compiling languages with nested statement structure a method of incremental compilation is presented which applies especially to programming languages in which statements can be nested such as algol and pli the method permits editing of the source language using a general purpose text editor and incremental processing of changes without frequent recompilation of entire routines the essential points of the method are the syntax of the language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur on lines an internal data structure called the skeleton is maintained to represent the statement structure the recompilation is partially batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines does not occur until the last of a set of editing commands has been received and the parsing and compilation are factored into two parts that done on individual lines and that done globally to handle the relationships between the lines cacm december 1972 earley j caizergues p incremental compiler interactive programming language 4.12 4.22 ca721203 jb january 27 1978 1:04 pm

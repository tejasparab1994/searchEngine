one way of estimating frequencies of jumps in a program for the segmentation of a program it is useful to have a reasonable estimation of the values of s where s is the mean value of the number of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th instruction in the run time in the cases where the s are estimated directly the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account therefore it is very difficult for the programmer andor the translator to obtain a good estimation of the s it is easier to estimate not s but the quantities psijcisumsij j1n where c is an arbitrary positive constant for each i although the p are for each i proportional to s the estimation of p is easier because we must estimate only the probabilities of events where instruction i is executed after instruction i this estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program in the first part of the paper using the theory of the markov chains an algorithm for the computation of the s from the p is found and some ways of obtaining estimates of the p are given in the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived avoiding the necessity of computation involving large matrices cacm july 1968 kral j object program reduction supervisor calls decreasing jump frequencies estimation control transfers estimation optimal program segmentation markov chain program correspondence program graph one-entry subgraph locally estimated jump frequencies supervisor overhead decreasing program segmentation algorithm jump frequencies program segmentation problem 4.11 4.19 4.39 4.49 ca680702 jb february 22 1978 3:05 pm

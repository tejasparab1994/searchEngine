merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2log2 3mp mplog2 steps if n m b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2log2 mp steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2log2 mp steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batchers algorithm which requires np 2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp 2mplog2 m in the special case where nkm cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am

partitioning algorithms for finite sets the partitions of a set with n elements are represented by certain n-tuples of positive integers algorithm are described which generate without repetitions the n-tuples corresponding to all partitions of the given set all partitions of the given set into m or fewer sets 1 m n and all partitions of the given set into exactly m sets 1 m n cacm october 1963 hutchinson g ca631008 jb march 13 1978 5:57 pm

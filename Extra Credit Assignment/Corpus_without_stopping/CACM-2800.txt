connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of a-stable formulas three criteria are given for a-stability it is shown that for pk k arbitrary a-stability implies certain necessary conditions for a-stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of p satisfy psi1 for pk2,34and 5 a-stability for k5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with pk3,4andor 5 a-stability implies a-stability cacm january 1975 liniger w stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy a-stability a-stability strict stability 5.17 ca750111 jb january 12 1978 9:26 am
